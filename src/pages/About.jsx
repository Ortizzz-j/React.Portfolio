            <p className='ap'>Currently working in transportation & logistics, I took on this journey into tech towards the end of 2022. I have since learned how to center a div, amongst other things like Node, a bit of dom manipulation, Restful Api's, MySQL & NoSQL (mongodb). I still have much more to learn and explore as i hope to take on some more Vite + React projects to better my understanding of state and how to use other react components. My goal is by the end of this year, 2023, or sometime next year I can be a developer at a company that share the same values as I do.</p>
