# React Portfolio

## Description
This is the second portfolio and the one I will be tweeking later on as I develop more skills as a developer. In it you can find the technologies I have used and have been exposed to in a project setting. You can also find languages that I hope to become familiar with as my time as a developer continues.

## Motivation
The motive for this project is to play around a bit with Vite + React. It was not really shown in the bootcamp that I have just completed this month of August 2023, but luckily our instructor decided to show us just how similar it is to react and challenged us to use Vite instead of just React.
